Question 1
Name the configuration file which holds HDFS tuning parameters

1 point

mapred-site.xml


core-site.xml


hdfs-site.xml

2.
Question 2
Name the parameter that controls the replication factor in HDFS

1 point

dfs.block.replication


dfs.replication.count


dfs.replication


replication.xml

3.
Question 3
Check answers that apply when replication is lowered

1 point

HDFS is less robust


Less likely that data will be local to more workers


Aggregate I/O rate will be worse


HDFS will have more space available

4.
Question 4
Check answers that apply when NameNode fails to receive heartbeat from a DataNode

1 point

DataNode is marked dead


NameNode will attempt to restart DataNode


No new I/O is sent to particular DataNode that missed heartbeat check


Blocks below replication factor are re-replicated on other DataNodes

5.
Question 5
How is data corruption mitigated in HDFS

1 point

Data from all replicas is compared for correctness


checksums are computed on file creation and stored on clients


checksums are computed on file creation and stored in HDFS namespace for verification when data is retrieved.
